        <article id="p1"><h3>Profile</h3></article>
        <p>Papyrus is a tall, perhaps anatomically inaccurate skeleton, with a skull more vertical and geometric than his brother. Being skeletal, many of his expressions incorporate a toothy grin. His eyes resemble vertical slits; his skeletal pseudo-brows form most of his expressions, as well as the corners of his mouth. He has eyeballs which show at times when he is experiencing strong emotions. Papyrus is relatively taller and slightly slimmer than his brother.</p>
        <article id="p2"><h3>Personality</h3></article>
        <p>Papyrus is a flamboyant skeleton who presents a confident, charismatic image of himself. He is thought to have an egotistical personality, referring to himself as "THE GREAT PAPYRUS," possibly as a way to feel as prestigious as his brother. He works hard and, despite his brash personality, is kind at heart. He is optimistic and brave, and is shown to be considerate and forgiving even when the protagonist beheads him in the Genocide Route.[3] He is also occasionally oblivious and nonobservant,[4][5] but can be cunning at times, as seen when he uses reverse psychology to trick Undyne into befriending the protagonist.[6] He is thought of to be somewhat naive by other characters, but not dumb. He shows great bravery as even in the face of potentially imminent death, he drops his guard and spares the protagonist hopes of driving them down a better path.</p>
        <p>Papyrus believes in others just as much as he believes in himself. He has so much faith in his abilities that he waited outside of Undyne's house all night and begged her to accept him into the Royal Guard. Seeing his persistence, Undyne offered to train him, but instead gave him cooking lessons.[7]His confidence in himself and others is so great that he interprets direct insults towards him as the protagonist trying to make themselves look bad so he can hurt them easier, rather than the possibility that they dislike him.</p>
        <article id="r2"></article><p>He cooks spaghetti from time to time(<a href="#i2">img2</a>), though many characters seem to think that he is not very good at it.[9][10] One of the reasons for this is because Papyrus never ate spaghetti himself to complete the chef's guidebook to cooking by tasting their creation before serving. He, therefore, cooks spaghetti only because everyone else loves to eat it, indicating he does not play favorites.[11] Since Undyne - whose results do not best Papyrus - teaches him, she is also responsible. He loves puzzles and japes, as shown by the numerous puzzles he prepares for the protagonist as well as his collection of "complex tomes about puzzle creation." Though advanced puzzles may seem cerebral, Papyrus also enjoys children's books[12] and is somewhat childish with the decoration of his room. He also collects action figures.</p>
        <p>He has some unexpected skills besides cooking however, such as consistently high-caliber artistic prowess from things such as: being able to paint a rock formation to look exactly like a bridge, creating a snow sculpture to look just like himself but with musculature, to the various puzzle designs he creates for the protagonist. He also has a photographic memory for phone calls, and the ability to perform physics-breaking acrobatics.</p>

        <article id="p3"><h3>Main Story</h3></article>
        <p>Sometime before the events of Undertale, Papyrus and his brother showed up one day in Snowdin and asserted themselves. Sometime after that, Papyrus became friends with Undyne and began training with her.</p>
        <p>Papyrus first appears in Snowdin Forest, where he arrives to check up on his brother. After learning that Sans had not made any progress over eight solid days, Papyrus, ignorant of the human hiding nearby, berates Sans for not recalibrating his puzzles.[20] He then delivers a long tirade to Sans that he will capture a human and become popular. Further in the forest, Papyrus meets the protagonist for the first time, though he initially confuses them for a rock.</p>
